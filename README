NuAcTool is the command-line script for
automation of basic operations on sequences of the nucleic acids.
The following operations are supported:
*coding DNA transcribing;
*reverse transcription of RNA;
*reverting 5' and 3' ends of RNA or DNA sequence;
*building a complementary strand for RNA or DNA,
complementing RNA for DNA input or DNA for RNA input sequences
is not supported;
*building reverse complement strand for RNA or DNA
input sequence, the same limitation as for building complementary strands;

Orientation of the input sequence is assumed to be in 5'-3' direction,
U and T bases in the same sequence is not considered as correct input.
